Think about someone (perhaps the client) who already knows WordPress taking over the
running of the site itself: how do they add new content – as a page or a post? In what category? You may have used a plugin for a calendar of events or something, which needs to be described. Do not recreate WordPress documentation, but clearly explain to the client’s site maintainer how this
particular site is organised and can be updated.
